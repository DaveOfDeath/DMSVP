  text: "Hey All, welcome to Stokers, home of the no-questions-asked coffin rental policy!\n\nI know we\'re only a couple scenes in, but this is our first real addition from the Dead Man\'s Switch Storyline. Touristville is pretty packed with extra tidbits, and we wanted to really highlight what additions have been made to the game since the release of DMS, and add a few touches of our own. We fully integrated the matrix, and give the matrix levels an overhaul. \n\n"

  text: "Specifically, one of our goals with Vox Populi is to add to the overall story to make a new experience for returning players while keeping the main storyline intact for new players. \n\nOne thing that we wanted to add was to have more areas of investigation in the game; some dead ends, leads that don\'t pan out exactly the way that you expect; and expand the investigation of Sam\'s murder beyond finding one thread and following that thread through to the end of the game."
