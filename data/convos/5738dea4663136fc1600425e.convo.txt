  text: "So welcome to the behind the scenes tour of our adaptation of the Harebrained Scheme\'s campaign \"Dead Man Switch\".\n\nI guess some basic introductions would probably be in order, in case you don\'t know who we are.   \n\nMy name is Dave. I was the project manager and lead scripter on the SRI: Mercurial mod, and a couple of us have set out to do it again. This time, we aimed an importing the DMS campaign into the HK editor, and give it a little love."

  text: "I\'m Matt. Or Mister L-Zero-G-Four-One-N. \n\nI was the lead writer on Mercurial with Dave, and the author of a few iterations of the Stuffer Shack mods.  For this endeavor, I was responsible for the new character interactions, story adjustments, and some of the new plot twists and things we added to change up the campaign a bit. \n\nI tried to make my entries blend as seamlessly as possible with existing writing; the greatest compliment that you could give me is that uncertainty between what was already in the game, and what has been added."

  text: "Ryan here. I wrote and scripted the Response Time mod, and did some work on the Mercurial project. My goal on this project was to keep it on track, and, since we\'re releasing it a year after planned, you could say I both failed and succeeded.\n\nThere were quite a few times when this project was stalled as jobs and family obligations changed for us. But each time someone would have to put their work on hold, another would pick up the ball and keep juggling. That this project was finished at all is a testament to our love of Shadowrun - and the power of guilt. I mean friendship, of course."

  text: "Now, If you\'ve got these turned on... You\'ll see some of the insight, thoughts, pain, pride, and spoilers that is behind the scenes during our development of this mod.\n\nThanks to a friend of ours \"Cirion\" for the idea of doing this.   Reading his DEV commentary throughout Caldecott Caper was really interesting to me.  If I found it neat, maybe other Mod-Devs will too.   "

(That\'s the switch to turn these on/off) just in case.\n\nThat said, Thank you for playing... and we hope you enjoy. "
