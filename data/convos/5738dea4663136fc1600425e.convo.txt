  text: "So welcome to the behind the scenes tour of our adaptation of the Harebrained Scheme\'s campaign \"Dead Man Switch\".\n\nI guess some basic introductions would probably be in order, in case you don\'t know who we are.   \n\nMy name is Dave. I was the project manager and lead scripter on the SRI: Mercurial mod, and a couple of us have set out to do it again. This time, we aimed an importing the DMS campaign into the HK editor, and give it a little love."

  text: "I\'m Matt. Or Mister L-Zero-G-Four-One-N. \n\nI was the lead writer on Mercurial with Dave, and the author of a few iterations of the Stuffer Shack mods.  For this endeavor, I was responsible for the new character interactions, story adjustments, and some of the new plot twists and things we added to change up the campaign a bit. I tried to make my entries blend as seamlessly as possible with existing writing. \n\nWe were aiming to highlight all the great things about the original campaign, giving veterans of the franchise something new, and new players something fun."
