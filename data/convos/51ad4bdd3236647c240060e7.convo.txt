  text: "Holmes\'s workbench falls somewhere between coroner\'s slab and medieval torture device. It is decorated in the many colors of death, and littered with the instruments of that trade. To one side, there is a leather-bound journal stuffed with uneven pages. To the other is a pocsec, its small screen still glowing. Beneath the bench is a rolled sheaf of papers held closed with a tied length of surgical tubing."
