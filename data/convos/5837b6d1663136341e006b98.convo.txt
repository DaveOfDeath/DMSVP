  text: "The Seamstress Union.\n\nBehind the scenes, the Seamstress Union is actually different scenes, with a common map. While it makes it easier to apply changes across multiple iterations of the scene, it\'s not really a HUB. Originally we intended to build a full hub, much like the Dragonfall or Hong Kong, but in interest of maintaining our timeline and any sense of progress, that had to be cut."

This scene here through, where the Loyalty missions all stem from is an actual Hub that keeps track of your individual visits. \n\nIt was the easiest way to insert the missions without compromising the other existing scenes."

To me, it\'s one of those immersion things that\'d be disappointing if it wasn\'t there.\n\nAgain... Pretty sure this is one of those \"eh\" moments for players, and a personal hurdle for me."

After some tinkering, and prodding, this became the home to one of the big story tweaks between DMS and DMS:VP.  I won\'t spoil it, but if you\'ve been paying attention, you probably know what\'s coming."
