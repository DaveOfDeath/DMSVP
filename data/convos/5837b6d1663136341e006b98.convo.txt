  text: "The Seamstress Union.\n\nBehind the scenes, this is actually different identical scenes, with a common map.   While it makes it easier to apply changes across multiple iterations of the scene, it\'s not really a HUB.   Originally we intended to build a full hub for DMS:VP, much like the DragonFall or Hong Kong hubs, but in interest of maintaining progress, we scraped that."

  text: "We decided to focus in on what we felt would make the largest impact, the addition of the fixed crew. This scene here through, where the Loyalty missions all stem from is an actual Seamstress Union Hub. It was the easiest way to insert the missions without compromising the other existing scenes.\n\nIt gave me a chance to build a randomly populated bar, and give those bar patrons random lines. Both of which I\'m pretty sure nobody but me would notice. To me, it\'s one of those immersion things that\'d be game-breaking if it wasn\'t there."
