  text: "We had the very cool opportunity to sit down and chat with Jordan Weisman and chat about games and this game in particular.\nJordan mentioned that he was the one who built the U.B. Levels. So when I was porting this game over into the HK engine, I left this one intact.\n\nI could have updated the matrix, and changed the fights around, but it seemed way cooler to leave his original plans in-game, as they were created."

  text: "Also, we loved the UB levels. There\'s multiple paths, avenues for every expertise, and so many ways to screw up that you\'re in upside down before you\'ve even started. And isn\'t that what Shadowrun is about?\n\nThe meet-and-greet Dave mentioned was also the pitch meeting for the game you have in front of you now. I\'d say the meeting went pretty well.\n\nThe Shadowrun rights are a murky quagmire, and it was an enormous show of faith from Jordan, Mitch, and everyone to allow us to work on this. \nIt is a burden we\'re grateful to have."
