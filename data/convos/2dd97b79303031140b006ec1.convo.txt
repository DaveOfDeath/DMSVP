The most likely is that she is working for Timothy Telestrian to undermine James Telestrian in front of the Board of Directors. Second, she may be stealing secrets for a rival megacorp seeking a competitive advantage. "

All employees have been actively discouraged from participating in the society, and executives have been forbidden from investigating."
