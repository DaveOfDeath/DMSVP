  text: "So... it\'s the Stuffer Shack... The best worst place to visit as a shadowrunner. It\'s been a staple in our P&P games for years, and it\'s the first mod that L0g41n put out for the original Shadowrun Returns workshop.\n\nThe scene was later imported into DF:DC, but it never really did work right after the initial game. Figured it was high-time we recreated the iconic (to us anyways) location and give Pike\'s Place a bit more to do."

  text: "Stuffer Shack was my first mod, and I was pretty proud to have Jordan and Mitch play through it. That\'s where the Mister 10-G-41-N nickname came from.\n\nWe were especially proud to innovate some scripting. We had custom scripting that auto-fired your own DocWagon, to keep solo runners alive. It had auto-adjusting difficulty to challenge, and multiple scenarios built into the single scene. We were pretty proud of it."

  text: "Unfortunately, those innovations were later swallowed up by engine improvements that did what we figured out a workaround for. Once the Dragonfall Director\'s Cut hit Steam, none of those little improvements worked anymore.\n\nIf you look carefully, it even made a cameo in our Mercurial campaign. It was just the runner meet up, in the backroom, but it was in there. We decided it was time to update the classic mod, we even got to use the new colorful shelves from HK to do it. Enjoy!"
