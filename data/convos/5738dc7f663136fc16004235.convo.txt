  text: "So... it\'s the Stuffer Shack... The best worst place to visit as a shadowrunner. It\'s been a staple in our P&P games for years, and it\'s the first mod that L0g41n put out for the original Shadowrun Returns workshop.\n\nThe scene was later imported into DF:DC, but as they updated the editor with new bells and whistles,  it never really did work right after that. We figured it was high-time we recreated the iconic  location and give Pike\'s Place a bit more to do."

  text: "Stuffer Shack was my first mod, and I was pretty proud to have Jordan and Mitch play through it. That\'s where the Mister 10-G-41-N nickname came from.\n\nWe were especially proud to innovate some scripting, like that auto-tuning difficulty and a script that triggered DocWagon when you died. It also had multiple scenarios built into the single scene. "

  text: "If you look carefully, it even made a cameo in our Mercurial campaign. It was just the runner meet up, in the backroom, but it was in there. We decided it was time to update the classic mod, we even got to use the new colorful shelves from HK to do it. Enjoy!"

  text: "This is one of the places we deviated from the original campaign, trying to update it for previous DMS players. We scrapped the junkie begging/fight for this two-tiered encounter. It will be a surprise for people expecting it, but hopefully a good surprise.\n\nWe are pretty proud of it, and it\'s time to give it an upgrade and facelift, much like our efforts on DMS."
