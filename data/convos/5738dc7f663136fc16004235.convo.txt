  text: "Welcome to the Stuffer Shack... The best worst place to visit as a shadowrunner. It\'s been a staple in our P&P games for years, and it\'s the first mod that L0g41n put out for the original Shadowrun Returns workshop.\n\nThe scene was later imported into DF:DC, but as they\'ve updated the editor with new bells and whistles, it never really did work right after that. We figured it was high-time we recreated the iconic  location and give Pike\'s Place a bit more to do."

  text: "Stuffer Shack was my first mod for SRR, and I was pretty proud to have Jordan and Mitch play through it. \n\nThat\'s where the Mister 10-G-41-N name came from.\n\nWe were especially happy to innovate some scripting: that auto-tuning difficulty, and triggered DocWagon from your own inventory when you died. \nThe original Stuffer Shack had six scenarios built into the single scene. You can check them from the payphone in the original (our Easter Egg- that\'s Dave and I in the picture)."

  text: "If you look carefully, the Stuffer Shack even made a cameo in Mercurial.\n\nThe back room of the Stuffer Shack  was used for the runner meet up, at the beginning of the game. \nWe got some colorful new shelf props in HK, and decided it was time to update the classic. Enjoy!"

  text: "This is one of the places we updated a surprise for previous DMS players. We cut the junkie begging/fight in lieu of this two-tiered encounter. \nIt will be a surprise, but hopefully a good surprise.\n\nWe are pretty proud of it, and it\'s time to give it an upgrade and facelift, like many our efforts on DMS."
