  text: "Welcome to my own personal hell. \n\nThis is the scene that derailed me the most during this build. Most of modding isn\'t the \'fun stuff\' you draw up in the design phase, it\'s boring \'typing in the same script in all these scenes because I didn\'t think of it until it was halfway done.\'\n\nI really struggled with building a new/interesting matrix using the Hong Kong tilesets. Came up with the idea of the \'scenic pond\' because it seemed Elf-like."

  text: "To be fair, my grand visions for a Telestrian Matrix revamp probably didn\'t help it.\n\nI wanted to integrate a stylized matrix- and why wouldn\'t elves have trees and stuff in their matrix iconography? Why wouldn\'t the deckers use bow and arrow as their attack program (because there\'s no sprite animations for bow and arrows, that\'s why).\n\nWe wanted to include custom props to make the Telestrian matrix a more \'fake natural\' version of the real world. \nI love Dave\'s koi pond concept, and it didn\'t require custom tree props that would have worked well but been a ton of work."

  text: "Now I know \'Elf Like\' isn\'t a good way to describe it, particularly not in Shadowrun, but I have far more experience with D&D, so that\'s what I went with.\nWhen I started it, I thought Telestrian was an \'all-elf\' corp.\n\nObviously, that\'s not the case. \n\nSo what I ended up with was a hybrid of the Dragonfall IC spawning-style, with a new security timer logic, and a unique Pond/Paradise look.\nI\'m really happy with how this turned out, but BOY was it a nightmare on me."

To me, this is where the real strengths are.  Probably because it\'s where MY strengths are.\n\nThe majority of the work that I do is completely invisible to the players.   Other people who have dabbled into the modding may notice something and think \"How is that possible\", but for the most part... Crickets.\n\nWhile that\'s not a really a bad thing, it is a personal hurdle for me."
