  text: "Dear Charles,\n\nWe have been trying to reach you for months. We have come to the Universal Brotherhood several times and every time have been told that we could not see you. Since you are not allowed to go online in any way the only way we can try to contact you is by letters, which we have done time and again with no response. \n\nHow can you forget the people that raised you, and loved you?\n\nMom and Dad"

  text: "From the desk of Monica Sachnoff \n\nDear Brian,\n\nI want you to know how happy the Universal Brotherhood has made me, but I am sad that I never get any responses from my letters to you. I would email or message you, but as you know from my letters we are not allowed to go online. \n\nYou know that I have loved you since the day you were born. Mom and Dad always gave me crap for never being able to pronounce your name when you were a baby, but it\342\200\231s been an endearing name for me to call you ever since. \n\nPlease reply to this letter!\n\nLove Sister Monica"
