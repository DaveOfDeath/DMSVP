  text: "This one was a nightmare for me.\n\nIn the scripting of this scene, this encounter is incredibly complicated to begin with, and of course we compounded that by adding a bunch of new stuff on top. Including the matrix! Not only was I updating this scene, replacing aging scripts with current equivalents, including loose threads that already existed and figuring out which of the existing scripts were actually being used."

But I\'ll let him go into that.\n\nAlso in this scene, we added a tie in for Shadowrun author Russel Zimmerman, who collaborated with us on this game. The Green Lucifer threads that we\'ve included that reference him and the Ancients. Again, I\'ll leave the explaining of this tie in to my brother.  \n\nAnother twist is Gino. You\'ll see."

  text: "We\'ll get more into Violet in subsequent scenes, but this is where we introduce her. We wanted to front-load the crew members as early as possible. If you played with a decker character through the first few scenes, you\'ve probably already met the troll decker for the crew- hers were the cameras you hacked in that early scene (and the tiny matrix node to run around in).\n\nViolet is special to me because she\'s named for my daughter, Violet.

  text: "She is also special because she\'s a tie-in for our previous campaign, Mercurial. In that game, my cameo was Mateo the troll, who sold out the main characters in that game, and a surprising number of people shot in the face. In this game, we turn that into the canon ending, and Violet\'s background is that her dad was shot in the face by some scummy-shadow-criminal. "

  text: "Russell Zimmerman (aka Rusty) is a Shadowrun author and all around good dude. He is a self-described \'greatest fan of the Ancients street gang\', and collaborating with him allowed up to tie in his anthology story (No Sharper Spur), as well as the other anthology story that referenced Green Lucifer (Worthy of His Salt). \n\nYou may notice the spikey-green guy (Green Lucifer) hanging out here, and several plot threads that reference him. This is a tip of the hat to our friend."
