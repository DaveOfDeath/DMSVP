  text: "Indeed I do! Doc Wagon\342\200\231s armed medical response teams are how runners live to fight another day. They\'re kind of like Blue Cross/Blue Shield meets Black Hawk Down. \n\nYou can buy their remote trauma kits and give them to your hired runners to revive them. A Doc Wagon trauma kit brings back one hired runner from Death\342\200\231s Door - kind of like a one-time-use resurrection pill. \n\nIs that cheating? Nah, it\342\200\231s a single player game - think of it more like easy mode! Anyway here\'s a trauma kit for you. You may need it."
