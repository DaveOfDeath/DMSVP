  text: "My dad is a big mesoamerican archeology fan so I kind of grew up with the Olmecs, Toltecs, Mayans, and Aztecs - and of course the calendar, which all of a sudden struck me as wonderful way of explaining where the magic comes from. The Mayan calendar has a 5,200 year long count, with each 5,200 years viewed as a new world - that timing almost lines up with the Judeo-Christian world-creation date of about 5,800 years ago (which is a little spooky).
