  text: "In the original Lone Wolf story that originated Paco and inspired the basic premise of this scene, the Cutter\'s base was just another dock warehouse or squalid tenement - depending on where you placed the event. But having just completed designing River\'s mission, building another dock scene sounded miserable. And I\'ve made more squalid tenement\'s since I started modding Shadowrun than I can count.\n\nI wanted to do something different. Something that had never been done in Shadowrun modding. After some casting about, I gradually decided on this scene."

  text: "A derelict airport terminal. Drawing from 80s movies like \"Escape from New York\" for lighting and theme, I began designing an escort quest. The original idea was that you and the good Doctor Castle would have to make your way through an airport of VITAS infected Cutter\'s to find and save Paco before he was too sick to save. After spending a few weeks designing Doctor Castle\'s powers and character sheets, I began building a map that would look and feel like a crumbling airport terminal, and also show off her unique powers and abilities."

  text: "I\'m sure you\'re looking at your companion crew member right now and thinking that it doesn\'t *look* like Doctor Castle. Well, there was some difficulty planning the hub interaction that would smoothly allow Paco to vanish without seeming ridiculous and other story concerns. So, Paco was swapped in for Castle, then Gino/Maria was swapped in for sick Paco, and the structure of the mission changed to reflect the abilities Paco brought to the table rather than Castle."

  text: "In the end, I\'m not as happy with Paco\'s mission as I was with River\'s. The ambiance of the airport seems right to me. The light of the outside coming in the windows, the flickering fire barrels, the unique background sound file. It *feels* like a spooky derelict airport terminal. But... The gameplay isn\'t nearly as interesting as I had hoped. The scavenger hunt for keys, the solo boss fights in cramped quarters, they just feel a bit off.\n\nI do like some of the subtle features, like the Cutter zombies becoming harder with each one subdued and the variable ways to skip the boss fights seems right. But overall, I\'m disappointed with myself."

  text: "Despite that, I think the speed of the mission helps offset some of the negative features. There\'s something to be said for brevity, and what it lacks in challenge I hope it makes up for in story. We learn a lot about Paco\'s life as a Cutter from the two Cutter bosses, and the Cutter business as an weapons warehouse is told through the layout of the airport.\n\nIt\'s not perfect, but it\'s unique, quick, and adds to the story. I hope you feel it\'s worthwhile, warts and all."
